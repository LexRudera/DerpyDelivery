#Derpy Delivery
Idea, concept and prototype by Grit  
Programming by Lex  

##Compilation
The software is compiled with the standard MinGW compiler.  
It is linked to the github version of the SFML 2 library.  
  
Everything is prepared in Code::Blocks, compiled and linked, producing the executable game file and.  

##Future
I have plans to make it more like an engine than an actual game, and make it very easy to customize. Derpy Delivery is then gonna be the standard addon campaign that comes with it when you download the package.  
I plan to make an editor as well, so you can with ease make your own maps and campaigns.
